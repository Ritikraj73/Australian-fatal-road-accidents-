# Australian-fatal-road-accidents-(1989-2021)
Domain: Data visualization | Programming Languages: Python,  SQL Project to learn in data analysis and visualization • Analyzed the main reasons and vehicles involved in road  accidents. • Used Tableau to represent the charts in more interesting form.
# About
This is a data analysis and visualization project that explores fatal road accidents in Australia. The project uses Python and SQL to analyze the dataset and Tableau to create visually appealing charts and graphs.

# Getting Started
To explore the data analysis and visualizations, simply open the Jupyter notebook file in your web browser or preferred development environment. The notebook contains all of the code used to analyze the dataset and create the visualizations.

To view the visualizations created in Tableau, simply open the Tableau file in your Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public application. The file contains various charts and graphs that provide insight into the main reasons and vehicles involved in fatal road accidents in Australia.

# Dataset
The Australian Fatal Road Accidents dataset contains information about fatal road accidents that occurred in Australia between 1989 and 2021. The dataset includes information about the location of the accident, the vehicles involved, and the factors that contributed to the accident.

# Analysis
The analysis in this project focuses on identifying the main reasons and vehicles involved in fatal road accidents in Australia. The analysis uses Python and SQL to clean and preprocess the data, and to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

The analysis found that the main reasons for fatal road accidents in Australia were speeding, alcohol and drug use, and driver distraction. The analysis also found that cars and motorcycles were the most commonly involved vehicles in fatal road accidents.

# Visualization
The visualizations in this project use Tableau to create charts and graphs that represent the data in a more interesting and engaging way. The visualizations include interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

The visualizations highlight the main reasons and vehicles involved in fatal road accidents in Australia. They also provide insight into the location and time of day when fatal road accidents are most likely to occur.
